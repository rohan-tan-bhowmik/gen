00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:15,640
Ah...

3
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:22,399
Please, wake up - wake up from my nightmare

4
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,219
I cannot breathe

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,380
In this world

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,980
Please, I beg you

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,600
Please let me wake

8
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:39,939
I'm waiting for help

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:51,799
Forever

00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:02,780
O Light - Kikuo Singer: Hanatan

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:12,439
On this dark, dark night

12
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,579
With these legs that can't carry me further

13
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,479
I'm waiting for dawn

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,280
Utterly still

15
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,359
Please, wake up

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,580
Please wake up from my nightmare

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,380
In this world

18
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,180
Full of illusions

19
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,859
Where, where am I supposed to be?

20
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,460
Here I am, wandering around

21
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:14,400
Forever

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,080
Where am I to be? (To be?)

23
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,580
There are so many reasons

24
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,299
I cannot be here

25
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:55,280
I'm being hung upside down in the air

26
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:03,000
Ah, someone wake me up!

27
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,379
Please, wake up

28
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,900
Please wake from my nightmare

29
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:12,459
I can't breathe

30
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,379
in this world

31
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,800
Please, somehow bring us to one another

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,300
For I believe there is salvation waiting for me

33
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,960
Please wake up!

34
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,379
Wake from this nightmare

35
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:39,020
On this planet, I cannot use my voice

36
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:44,939
Where, where am I supposed to go?

37
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:54,259
I'm yearning for you

38
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,700
In utter stillness

39
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,419
Forever

40
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:08,919
Forever...

41
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:27,740
O Light HIKARI YO
