1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,219
On the roof of the last train,

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,019
fragments of me were forgotten

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,140
Gathered together, grilled, and eaten

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,800
You were visible from the sky

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,380
You're always the same

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,739
I never change either

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,280
Without a place, I found myself

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,800
merely wandering about the town

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,060
'Cuz I wanna spend these endless nightmares together with you

10
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,519
I put out the little lamp of hope holding you up

11
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:11,420
Before the cracks in my heart can be filled up by a maze,

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,859
I'll lead you away to a star

13
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:18,179
where nobody else can reach

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,140
Come along, come along,

15
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,579
We are being called by that far away star

16
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,160
It's okay, it's okay

17
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,619
You can say goodbye now, it's okay.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,200
Come along, come along,

19
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,620
Even if you die, I will forgive you

20
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,600
So it's okay, it's okay,

21
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,420
I whisper to you

22
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:21,019
I'll accept it, accept it, all of you.

23
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,119
I lure you out of the valley of emotion

24
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,620
Return them, return them, my forgotten things

25
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:48,340
'Cuz I wanna spend these endless nightmares together with you

26
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,600
I light the great big lamp of despair holding you up

27
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,060
On the roof of the last train,

28
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,800
fragments of me were forgotten

29
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:10,039
Don't overlook the gloom that sinks into my eyes

30
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,860
Come along, come along,

31
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,780
Since you were seen from such a far away star

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,040
It's okay, it's okay,

33
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,400
'Cuz I whisper to you

34
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,180
Come along, come along,

35
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,599
Even if you die, I'll forgive you

36
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,620
So it's okay, it's okay

37
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,620
It'd really be alright.
