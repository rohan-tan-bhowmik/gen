1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,620
When I grow up, I’ll come to save you

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,280
At that place, where you said you’d wait.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,860
The selfish promise we made long, long ago

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,320
Last night by the cherry blossoms, you weren’t there.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
Even so, I’ll continue to wait

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,900
I'll be there when you smile

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,820
While watching you smile,

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,019
I wanted to take in the blossoming cherry trees

9
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:36,740
The moonlight streaming through the full blossoms

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,320
Underneath God's cherry tree

11
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:43,799
With cut off breaths, you are

12
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,659
covered in wounds, covered in wounds, covered in wounds,

13
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:50,939
covered in wounds, covered in wounds...

14
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:58,179
How, how, how can this be?

15
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,059
All this time, it’s like

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,579
I’ve never even seen the real you.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,200
The scattering cherry blossoms twinkled like stars

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,799
Glittering with blood, tears and fresh wounds

19
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,399
Your beautiful, grotesque appearance

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,980
I sought to save that fleeting expression

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,560
Yet with just a single glance

22
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:30,859
I fell in love

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,560
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love it!

24
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,219
The beautiful you

25
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:48,719
completely covered head to toe in wounds

26
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,320
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love it!

27
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,739
While gazing at your smile

28
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,280
I wiped away the tears with my bloody hands.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,960
Both your heart and your body are covered in fresh wounds

30
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,419
While dizzily looking back at you

31
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,599
More than your smile, it seems as if,

32
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:24,840
as if I've discovered something even more beautiful

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,060
I'll run, I'll run, run to meet you

34
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,719
I'll even run to your place

35
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,300
Before we get there you will make that sudden turn

36
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,040
A world of just the two of us

37
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,519
A closed up world so no one can see

38
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,080
Right now I feel like I can do anything

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,659
Even make those noisy adults shut up

40
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:26,439
We can do, we can do it

41
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,800
In our closed up world

42
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:33,579
I can make you

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,480
I can make you even more beautiful

44
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,659
I love, I love, I love,  I love,  I love, I love it!

45
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,140
The beautiful you

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,659
completely covered head to toe in wounds

47
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:06,219
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love it!

48
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,580
If it's me, I can give you

49
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,340
even more beautiful wounds

50
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,840
I used to cherish the memory of your smile but

51
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,339
I can't live like that anymore

52
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,599
Since I have come to know

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,220
an even more beautiful side of you

54
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,620
The cherry blossoms are quick to fall

55
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,540
Cherry blossoms before dawn

56
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,880
Things like the memory of your smile

57
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:02,360
Along with God's cherry tree

58
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:11,439
The fleeting beauty is sure to scatter, right?
