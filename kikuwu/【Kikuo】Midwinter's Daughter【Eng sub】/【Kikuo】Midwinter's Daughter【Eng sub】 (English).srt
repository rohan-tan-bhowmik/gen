1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,500
Inside of the snow,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,879
melting, melting, disappearing,

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,759
Midwinter's daughter, we will embrace, will embrace,

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,699
embrace forever

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,620
Dance with me, thump, thump, thump

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,300
No way, no way la la la

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,159
I really hate to dance

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,740
I am disliked by you

9
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,399
And so we'll dance, but we'll dance poorly

10
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,199
In the short springtime, we'll be merry

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,140
Cheerfully, you accepted

12
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,140
Winter in the nude

13
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,439
a lifeless and chill wind

14
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:05,599
makes the single dead tree lonely

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,599
suck it in until you're tired

16
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,299
play until you're tired

17
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,719
oh wanting dancer

18
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:18,839
Inside of the snow,

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,020
Melting, melting, disappearing

20
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,239
Like the shriveled up tree,

21
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,640
I'll embrace you

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,859
the frost is sure to come

23
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,200
to chill, to chill, and freeze us over

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,340
Midwinter's daughter;

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,620
we will embrace, will embrace, embrace forever

26
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,980
The warmth that greeted my naked body

27
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,180
I clung onto that frozen body

28
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,500
You can no longer escape,

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,459
Accepting every last bit of me

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,939
Dance with me, thump, thump, thump

31
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:11,060
Okay, okay la la la

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,819
You are once again

33
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,000
about to recieve spring

34
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,860
in the midst of my warmth

35
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,819
Over time, over time,

36
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,319
let's go

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,540
Inside of the snow

38
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,799
Melting, melting, becoming nothing

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,219
I held onto

40
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,419
your dead and withered body

41
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:53,719
The frost is sure to come

42
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,759
forever, forever, staying frozen

43
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,280
If it's midwinter's daughter,

44
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,219
we will embrace, will embrace, embrace to the end
