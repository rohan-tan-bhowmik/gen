00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:12,000
And so you became the moon while  I became a star in the universe

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,500
By the bank of the Milky Way, we'll always be together!

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,000
And then I crumbled and fell apart  and the moon fell into the open hole

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We'll be together forever even at  the very bottom of the universe! hyuu hyuu hyuu uu

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,500
And then you Became the Moon

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,500
She's swaying, I put the moon's head into my pocket

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,500
The dead moon's night sky is darkly darkly falling down

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Spinning spinning the maddened Yukionna is dancing

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:06,500
With frozen eyes I -- d r i p

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:13,500
The collapsed body fell from the sky  with frozen eyes I -- d r i p

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,500
d r i p d r i p d r o p d r o p d r o p d r o p

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,500
And so I became a star and  you became the moon in the universe

14
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,000
Next to the aurora lights, we'll always be together!

15
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,500
While looking at moon from the very bottom of  Naraku on to the opposite side of the Yukionna

16
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,000
While looking at moon from the very bottom of Naraku

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:09,000
La la la...

18
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't hear anything, I can't touch anything,  I can't move but I can still see

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,500
Inside the warm pocket that I was placed into

20
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Spinning spinning the painful trembling is kindly

21
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Letting me sleep comfortably d r i p

22
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,500
In the night sky I bid farewell to the broken you  d r o p d r i p

23
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,500
d r i p d r o p d r i p d r o p

24
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:05,000
And so you became the moon,  the gloomy and broken me

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,500
The broken lump keeps shining

26
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:18,580
And so I became a star, the moon won't shine anymore

27
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:25,500
The star is also disappearing into the light

28
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,500
And so both the moon and the star disappear,  the disappeared couple cannot be found anywhere

29
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:39,000
At the very bottom of the universe,  they are together forever!

30
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,500
And so the moon and star disappear,  that is a bedtime fairytale

31
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:57,000
At the very bottom they are together forever!
