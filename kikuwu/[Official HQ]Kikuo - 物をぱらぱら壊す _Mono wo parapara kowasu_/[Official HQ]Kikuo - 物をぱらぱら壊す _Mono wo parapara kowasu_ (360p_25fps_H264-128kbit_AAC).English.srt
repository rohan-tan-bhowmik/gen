00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,819
Why is it so fun to destroy things? Olé!

Translation: Releska

3
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:14,099
Since I became aware, I’ve destroyed a whole bunch of things:

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,660
Clocks, teacups, remote controls, building blocks…

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,899
Important and precious things are particularly entertaining:

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,620
Dolls, puzzles, phones, photos…

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,000
Whether they got mad or cried, everyone looked so scared. Still…

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,140
Things are so easy to break, and they’ve taken such good care of them

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,179
yet they leave them in arm’s reach.

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:42,960
I get all weird and find the tension so fun. Silently, I reach out.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,820
pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,579
It’s especially fun to break your things.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,340
pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter

14
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,839
Your valuables are even more fun to break.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,600
Things are all in pieces.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,079
Close, open…

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,719
I can’t have fun if it’s just once

18
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:09,039
so I fix it, break it, fix it, and break it again.

19
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:16,219
You, too, forget what it originally looked like.

20
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:31,619
I’ve even demolished things crammed full of memories:

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,820
Stuffed toys, plastic models, pianos, letters…

22
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,420
I’ve even carefully demolished things full of feelings:

23
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,539
Musical instruments, paintings, pottery, sculptures…

24
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:45,299
When people put their hopes and feelings in things,

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,500
Their souls cross over and dwell in them, since they’ll last forever.

26
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,120
The more precious things exist, the more souls there are.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:00,579
They breathe fragilely, enjoy life, and are then silently killed.

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,900
pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter

29
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,180
I want to keep breaking your soul.

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,939
pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter,

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,979
I want to erase your living soul.

32
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:17,780
In pieces, in pieces,

33
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,120
things end up in pieces

34
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,759
and the moment your soul vanishes…

35
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,780
I’ll fix it, I’ll break it

36
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,219
I’ll fix it and break it.

37
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,120
I laugh and you cry.

38
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:42,979
la, la, la, la...

39
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,359
Still,

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,820
pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,000
You followed along. You love me.

42
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,879
pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter

43
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,979
I love you, who also loves me.

44
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,780
pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,540
Your soul is possessing me now.

46
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,359
pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,419
My soul is possessing you now.

48
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,159
pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter

49
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,239
I crumble up your precious thing.

50
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,319
pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,260
It feels so good the moment it vanishes.

52
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,060
pitter-patter, pitter-patter

53
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,259
I destroyed myself, so precious to you,

54
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,239
So I fix it and break it and then

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,159
I can’t fix it. I can never

56
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,680
say sorry to you.
