1
00:00:04,536 --> 00:00:07,706
And so you became the moon

2
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,076
<i>(sky) while I became a star in the universe</i>

3
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:12,077
Beside the Milky Way

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:14,080
<i> Beside the Milky Way</i>

5
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:14,447
Beside the Milky Way

6
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,250
We'll always be together!

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,222
And then I crumbled and fell apart

8
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:25,357
And the moon fell into the open hole

9
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:28,695
We'll be together forever

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,164
even at the very bottom of the universe!

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,435
Moon

12
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,470
And so you became the Moon

13
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:37,536
And so you became the

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,540
She's swaying

15
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:45,045
I put the moon's head into my pocket

16
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:48,647
The dead moon's night sky is

17
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,483
Darkly   darkly

18
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,185
Falling down

19
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:59,192
Spinning   spinning   the maddened Yukionna is dancing

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,998
with frozen eyes I --

21
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:05,432
d r i p with frozen eyes I --

22
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:06,299
d r o p d r o p with frozen eyes I --

23
00:01:06,331 --> 00:02:12,697
with frozen eyes I --

24
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:06,832
The collapsed body fell from the sky  with frozen eyes I --

25
00:01:06,865 --> 00:01:08,435
The collapsed body fell from the sky

26
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,471
The collapsed body fell from the sky

27
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:24,150
And so I became a star

28
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:27,653
And you became the moon in the universe

29
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:30,557
Next to the aurora lights

30
00:01:30,722 --> 00:01:32,792
We'll always be together!

31
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,996
And then I fell down and disappeared

32
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,966
on to the opposite side of the Yukionna

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,167
While looking at moon from the very bottom of Naraku on to the opposite side of the Yukionna

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,272
While looking at moon from the very bottom of Naraku

35
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:16,870
I can't hear anything

36
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:17,069
I can't touch anything I can't hear anything

37
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,872
I can't touch anything

38
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:20,139
I can't move

39
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,875
But I can still see

40
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:22,274
Inside the warm pocket that I was placed into But I can still see

41
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:29,382
Inside the warm pocket that I was placed into

42
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:35,989
Spinning spinning     the painful trembling is kindly

43
00:02:37,022 --> 00:02:41,793
letting me sleep comfortably

44
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:41,995
d r i p letting me sleep comfortably

45
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:42,594
d r i p

46
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:42,694
d r o p d r i p

47
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,196
d r o p

48
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,536
In the night sky I bid farewell to the broken you

49
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,780
And so you became the moon

50
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:01,980
The gloomy and broken me

51
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:10,990
the broken lump keeps shining

52
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,694
And so I became a star

53
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:18,397
The moon won't shine anymore

54
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,467
The star is also disappearing

55
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,971
Into the light

56
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,374
And so both the moon and the star disappear

57
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:32,177
The disappeared couple cannot be found anywhere

58
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,181
At the very bottom of the universe

59
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,484
they are together forever!

60
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,455
And so the moon and star disappear

61
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,992
That is a bedtime fairytale

62
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:47,492
At the very bottom they are together forever!

63
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:55,968
At the very bottom they are together forever!
