Translation by Achamo

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,500
If I go to hell I'll be saved,

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
if I rise up to heaven we can meet again.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I love you, begging

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to be constricted, in comfort, in comfort

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,159
A Happy Death

7
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,980
"More, more. Strangle me harder."

8
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,399
Gasping in a child-like voice:

9
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:18,679
"I love you."

10
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:29,959
In a weak voice:

11
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,079
"Goodbye."

12
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:44,319
"Thank you," you whispered, and then died.

13
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,779
If I fall to hell I'll be saved,

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
if I rise up to heaven we can meet again.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Please give me my punishment in hell.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're in heaven, pure.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,500
If that world's nothingness, let's go there.

18
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
I want to see you. Can I?

19
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:21,000
Now, for me, a blissful death

20
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,500
I want to, I want to die like this.

21
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:14,000
I love you, able to answer so honestly and purely.

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:28,500
In a happy-sounding voice "Is this okay?"

23
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:43,000
"Does it feel good?" I whispered, and killed you.

24
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,500
If I fall to hell I'll be saved,

25
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,000
if I rise up to heaven we can meet again.

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Please give me my punishment in hell.

27
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
You'll go to heaven, pure.

28
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,000
If my sins are cleared, let's meet there.

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Come, come.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
A blissful death to you as well.
