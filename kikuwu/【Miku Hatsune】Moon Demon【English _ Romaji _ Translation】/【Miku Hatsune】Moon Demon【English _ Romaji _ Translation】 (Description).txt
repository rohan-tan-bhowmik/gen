I've been wanting to do a kikuo song and this is one of my favorites from him. Unlike his other upbeat crazy-like songs this one is more jazzy and dancy. I love the art too.

The sound of the moon resounds in the night.
Haha haha haha 
The moon demons dance.

 
The children's voices disappear.
Mother's death agony is far away 
Lalala Hahaha
as she's turned her attention towards the moon
as she's listening for the moon's call.

If you don't wont' to be broken
then come this way and play, children, with the moon of this evening...



The clouds sink in the light in the night.
Haha haha haha 
A party of full moon demons.


Your life is ending.
 

Before your last cry can be heard
Lalala Hahaha  
as you turn your attention toward the moon
as you listen for the moon's call.

Before you are broken I cast a spell on you.
Come this way children and play with tonight's pleasant crescent moon...
