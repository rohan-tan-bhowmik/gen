1
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:13,779
I’ve existed on this seashore but

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,359
The real me descended from above

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,900
Hate the light shining this place

4
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:24,359
This body is familiar to the night

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,660
Disappearing, disappearing, transparent, transparent

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,079
Darkness flying with leisure

7
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,159
Looking to the starry sky

8
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,859
Where it doesn’t compete the open sea

9
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,199
Now, nothing’s here

10
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:06,379
The sun rises, rises, rises, rises

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,640
My own existence

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,640
Can’t be seen here

13
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,899
The sun rises, rises, rises, rises

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,140
This place where my breaths are leaving

15
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,019
Nothing but fragments of my existence

16
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,659
It doesn’t feel good (it doesn’t feel good)

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,460
It doesn’t feel good (it doesn’t feel good)

18
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,840
It doesn’t feel good

19
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,139
I’m hearing everything, but no one is here

20
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,959
Today’s firstborn will leave, feathers intact

21
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,400
As this gap should be dark as night

22
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,099
I’m enamored by the morning sun to no avail

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,080
The sun is shining, shining, shining, shining

24
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,300
My own blood

25
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,379
Can’t be seen here

26
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:16,519
The sun is shining, shining, shining, shining

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,680
This place where I’m exchanging

28
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,580
Glances to the light; my jumbled thoughts

29
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,219
Doesn’t feel good (it doesn’t feel good)

30
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,900
Doesn’t feel good (it doesn’t feel good)

31
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,640
Doesn’t feel good

32
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,560
The sun rises, rises, rises, rises

33
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,560
My own existence

34
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,280
Can’t be seen here

35
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,840
The sun rises, rises, rises, rises

36
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,139
This place where my breaths are leaving

37
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,060
Nothing but fragments of my existence

38
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,680
It doesn’t feel good (it doesn’t feel good)

39
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:59,399
It doesn’t feel good (it doesn’t feel good)

40
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,080
It doesn’t feel good (it doesn’t feel good)

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,800
It doesn’t feel good (it doesn’t feel good)

42
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,140
It doesn’t feel good
