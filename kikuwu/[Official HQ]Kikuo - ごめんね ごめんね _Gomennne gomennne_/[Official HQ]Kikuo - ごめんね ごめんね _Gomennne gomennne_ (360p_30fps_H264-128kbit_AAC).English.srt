1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:22,000
He opens my ribs and drinks my soup

2
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:33,039
With a personal kiss from my stomach

3
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,659
I don't think I have any taste

4
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:53,619
But if it makes Papa happy...

5
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:22,680
Suck up my yellow fat with a straw  Stick it into my pee-pee and suck it up like that too

6
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:31,400
Fill it up with my poop and bake it  Even though my body is collapsing for Papa's sake

7
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,620
I'm sorry, after all, I don't have a good feeling

8
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,540
A big brother I don't know told me, ahh

9
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:47,680
Even though my collapsed body is pitiful, he kindly reaches out a hand

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,359
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I must be a bad girl

11
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,900
So forgive me, forgive me, poor little me

12
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,219
I'm sorry, goodbye, I'm a bad girl for running away from Papa

13
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm sorry, forgive me for falling in love with someone who's not Papa

14
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:34,580
Big Brother gulps down my amniotic fluid. He breaks open my hard stomach and touches the inside

15
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:43,380
Without eating me, he treats me gently  Even though my collapsed body is ugly

16
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,639
I'm sorry, that's not a good feeling I have

17
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,439
Big Brother must hate me, ahh

18
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:59,599
My collapsed body gives a bad feeling  It can be kept on file, and it's the end

19
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,340
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I must be a bad girl

20
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,860
So forgive me, forgive me, lonely little me

21
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,240
I'm sorry, goodbye, I'm a bad girl for returning to Papa

22
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:20,360
I'm sorry, forgive me for not being able to love my cruel Papa

23
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,720
When he came home, Papa was with a lot of people

24
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,539
They said they had believed I'd return

25
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:43,319
They want to eat my collapsed body until the end  That's what they said

26
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,079
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I must be a bad girl

27
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,560
So forgive me, forgive me, poor little me

28
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,960
I'm sorry, is it tasty? That's the taste of a warm heart

29
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,180
I'm sorry, even though it hurts, my heart is satisfied

30
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I must be a bad girl

31
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,060
So forgive me, forgive me, lonely little me

32
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,420
I'm sorry, even though it hurts, as long as you eat me and it tastes good,

33
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:26,199
I'm happy, goodbye, everybody eat up except for my heart
