1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:10,480
In a night filled with difficulty,  I become a wolf

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:22,560
The moon's day is being filled up with the blood's unceasing noise; I can't wait

3
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:55,380
A bear is just a face with tears,

4
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:05,480
And seven colors are glaring, dancing, at the starry sky and hollering

5
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:15,579
In a night filled with difficulty, I become a wolf

6
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:23,979
Tonight, bathe in the blood at the party slipping and sliding about.

7
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:34,460
As I keep getting hurt, I can't protect it

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,579
Burn it until it's ruined; then serve it

9
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:50,060
The black blood overfills in my chest, as like drowning in the tide.

10
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:22,420
With our backs facing the full moon, let's invite them in

11
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:33,659
To the best, it is so good; that fleeting feeling..

12
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:43,840
The body is rotting away from under the domination from that beast

13
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:55,500
The fakes boredom makes it so the people can not return to their own world.

14
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:05,659
In a night filled with difficulty, I become a wolf

15
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:15,000
I rejoice many times as the unseen end of the party draws near

16
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:24,639
As I keep getting hurt, I can't protect it

17
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:38,520
My starved blood is being reflected in their eyes, in their eyes.

18
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,240
Ooh, Aah!

19
00:03:51,740 --> 00:04:06,860
La la la la, la la la la, la la la la la la la la
