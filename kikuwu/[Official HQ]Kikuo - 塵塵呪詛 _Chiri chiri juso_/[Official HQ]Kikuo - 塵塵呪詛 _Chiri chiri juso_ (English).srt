1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,300
Our ending is the ending of the world

2
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,500
The ending of the world is the ending of everyone

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Your very onset will take someone else's place

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Someone else's ending will be our place to take

5
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,559
*chuckle* *chuckle* *chuckle* *chuckle*

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:47,560
The cursed paper-doll bearing our name has gone

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,900
Inside the fairy-like dancing flame, a lonely person turns into dust

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,640
Here we go!

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,539
Dusty Dusty Dusty Dusty

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,500
Reduced to dust and fly away

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,040
Crackle Crackle Crackle Crackle

12
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,560
Turn to ashes and fly away

13
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:15,019
Dusty Dusty Dusty Dusty

14
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:17,420
Scorching and soaring

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,219
Crackle Crackle Crackle Crackle

16
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:26,000
See who will be the last one standing?

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,799
Our ending is the ending of the world

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,000
The ending of the world is the ending of everyone

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,500
Your very onset will take someone else's place

20
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,000
Someone else's ending will be our place to take

21
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:32,000
Your pathetic self that nobody knows is now locked inside a box where you'll unable to see the dawn

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Wrapped under the light of dancing moonlight, in your last final glance...

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,080
who do you see?

24
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,979
Here we go!

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,580
Dusty Dusty Dusty Dusty

26
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,460
Reduced to dust and disappear

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,659
Crackle Crackle Crackle Crackle

28
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,960
Turn into fine powder and fly away

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,039
Dusty Dusty Dusty Dusty

30
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:01,959
Scorching and soaring

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,360
Crackle Crackle Crackle Crackle

32
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:10,500
See who will be the last one standing?

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,919
*chuckle* *chuckle* *chuckle* *chuckle*

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:40,240
*chuckle* *chuckle* *chuckle* *chuckle*
