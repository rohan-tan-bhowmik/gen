1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,379
You're a useless, useless, useless child

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,980
The most useless child in entire world

3
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:18,179
You are useless child

4
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:22,779
Song by : Kikuo

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,980
Study, exercise, speaking, you can't do anything

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,899
You're a poor and dull dirty brat

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:39,799
You can't even say your own name, yet I still love you

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,920
drooling, booger, dandruf, and piss

9
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,939
I do not mind it cry-baby, don't mind, don't mind

10
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,379
Come here, let me protect you

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,600
together, together, together with me

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,780
La la,  Lullaby for good night

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,840
What song do you want to sing together,

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,180
Let's sing it,  Let's sing it together with me,...

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,340
oh lonely child, child

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,299
You're a useless, useless, useless child

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,879
The most useless child in entire world

18
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,579
You're a useless, useless, useless child

19
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:24,640
If it were not for me, you would be dead child

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,980
You're a useless, useless, useless child

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,880
sad, sad, and good for nothing

22
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:35,819
You're a useless, useless, useless child

23
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,799
I will be the one who help you

24
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:55,019
Monster, Ghost, Insignificant human,

25
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,939
Urinal ornament, rejected from school

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,799
A loud voice from the dry mouth.

27
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,459
Let’s listen to scream of a stick.

28
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:10,159
Nevertheless time goes on and on

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,219
You don't have enough brain nor time, child

30
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,280
It’s too late,  you’re mentally retarded

31
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh sweet child, good child of mine

32
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,259
La la,  Lullaby for good night

33
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,979
Let's sleep tight with me

34
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,780
Dance, Dance, Always dancing oh lonely...

35
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,659
child, child, child, child

36
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,679
You're a useless, useless, useless child

37
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,859
The most useless child in entire world

38
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,500
You are lonely, lonely, lonely child

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,660
I will protect you forever

40
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,859
But I can't keep the child with me

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,020
child ran away from my side

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,900
Without consider all the wounds

43
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,039
Still it was just what happen

44
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,060
child, child child, child

45
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,580
I’m a useless, useless, useless child

46
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:20,500
There is no useless child anymore

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,719
I’m a useless, useless, useless child

48
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,280
No body help me anymore

49
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,159
I'm lonely, lonely, lonely child

50
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,659
There is no lonely child anymore

51
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,139
I'm lonely, lonely, lonely child

52
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,420
If only I can turn back the time
