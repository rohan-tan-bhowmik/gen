1
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:26,100
The god of death reflected on the evening sea

2
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:33,600
It catches my dissolving heart

3
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,919
I feel good

4
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:56,679
I slowly made up my mind

5
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:04,459
Here, the tender darkness averts

6
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,980
its eyes to death,

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,980
and embraces me

8
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:29,119
Hey, world's kindest god of death

9
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,319
Take good care of me tonight

10
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,719
Melting away, melting away, melting away

11
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:48,519
The last night

12
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,400
Disappearing, disappearing

13
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:01,659
Within the greatest pleasure

14
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:53,959
The paradise illuminated by a rainbow lantern

15
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:01,479
Lifts up my dying body

16
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,479
gently

17
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:24,039
It whispers quietly

18
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:32,219
Now and that time,

19
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,960
Feathers hold me softly

20
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,439
and release

21
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey, world's kindest god of death

22
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,360
Where are you taking me?

23
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:12,819
Melting away, melting away, melting away

24
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,639
The last heart

25
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,459
Disappearing, disappearing

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,120
Within the greatest pleasure

27
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:35,759
Falling away, falling away, falling away

28
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,879
gently and lightly

29
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,639
Soaring off, soaring off

30
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:53,259
toward the greatest pleasure
