1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,679
Come, come here crow

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:12,839
Into the pitch black darkness

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:18,879
I’ll give you candy that can’t melt away

4
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:25,000
So give me your wings and feet, ok?

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,800
I’ll give you a balloon that cannot break

6
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,839
Let’s have fun blowing it up forever

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,800
Come, come here crow

8
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:00,799
Into the pitch black swirl

9
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:06,719
I’ll give you a lung that cannot drown

10
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,920
So give me your memories of the sky

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,800
So, dance with a body that can no longer fly

12
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,840
Until it echoes with only dried bones

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,880
Come, I’ll grant you an eternity

14
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:39,799
Until you become a doll wandering in a dream

15
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,840
Stars that don’t disappear

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,920
A sun that doesn’t go down

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,079
Let’s enjoy it together

18
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:33,739
Let’s finish this game

19
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,860
Until you wither up

20
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,900
Give me your soul please

21
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,780
So, dance with a body that can no longer fly

22
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,860
Until it echoes with only dried bones

23
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,780
Come, I’ll grant you an eternity

24
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,900
Until I completely drink your body dry

25
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,780
Let’s end this dance

26
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,939
Until you rot away

27
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:22,020
Let’s enjoy it together
