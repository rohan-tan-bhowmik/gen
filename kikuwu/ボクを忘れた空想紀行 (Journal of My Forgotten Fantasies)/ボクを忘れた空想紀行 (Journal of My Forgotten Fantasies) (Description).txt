Another lovely song from Kikuo. As always, Miku's voice is absolutely beautiful especially on the long, drawn-out notes. Enjoy! Translation notes are below.

title: ボクを忘れた空想紀行 (Boku wo Wasureta Kuusou Nikki)
English title: Journal of My Forgotten Fantasies
song: Kikuo
singer: Hatsune Miku
art: not mine, please PM me if you know who the artist is!
translation and subs: me
album: Kikuomiku
nico original: http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/nm12105428

Translation notes: 

The "miku miku" at the beginning doesn't really translate to anything, so I'm fairly sure Miku's just saying her own name. This would also make sense because the original art for the song was a picture of her.

Also, the word "mikkuri" is used in several places instead of "hikkuri," which means to turn upside down. I'm 99% sure this is just a play on words, though, because a lot of the nico nico comments seemed to comment on it a lot and think it was really funny.

Please PM me if you have suggestions for the subs! Thanks :)

I own nothing except my own translation and subtitles!
